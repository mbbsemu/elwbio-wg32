## Compilation

This is a Worldgroup 3.2 module. It's compiled using Borland C/C++ 5.0. If you have a working Worldgroup 3.2 development kit, a simple "make -f ELWBIO" should do it! 

## Packing Up

The RELEASE folder includes all of the items that should be packaged up in a ELWBIO.ZIP. When unzipped in a Worldgroup 3.2 installation folder, it "installs" the module.

See the ELWBIO.DOC folder for more information on the app!
